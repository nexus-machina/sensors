Features to implement in the Adafruit STEMMA Soil Sensor

[] LED Indicator Control 
	Feature: Allow contorl of the LED (turn it on/off, adjust brightness)
	Enhancements
		- Create patterns or blinking behaviors to indicate status (e.g sensor 
		ready, error, or low moisture levels)

[] Soil Moisture Measurement
	Feature: Retrieve and process the soil mosture reading
	Enhancements:
		- Normalize the raw capacitiance reading sinto persentage values (0 - 100%)

[] Temperature Measurement
	Feature: Read temperature values in Celsius and Fahrenheit 

[] Power Management 
	Feature: Implement low-power modes
	Enchancements:
		 - Enable sleep/wake functionality for energy-efficient operation
		 	- Using I2C, put the microntroller into a low-power state and wake
			 it only when a measurement is needed

[] I2C Address Configureation
	Feature: Read & change the I2C address dynamically.
